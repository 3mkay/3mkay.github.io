							<li>Stand-up poll: Estimators</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Firstly I'd like to thank you all for coming to my session. 
							My name is Mike King, and depending on who you are and where you work, I could be called a 
							Project Manager, Product Manager, Delivery Manager or something else which essentially means 
							that I try to act in the best interest of the end user to give them a loveable product. </p>
							
							<p>I've been working in the web industry since 1995 and have managed teams and projects since around
								 the year 2000.</p>
							<p>More recently I've been working with teams to help them improve their 
								agile adoption using workshops, games and live project changes.</p>

							<p>Stand-up poll 1: <br>
								We're going to do a little audience participation. Can everyone stand.<br>
								Please take your seat if you do not estimate anything in your projects. You got off lightly!<br>
								Now, could those people who estimate up to 50% of cards, issues or any other items or work please sit down.<br>
								If we've done this right, everyone one left standing estimates between 50% and 100% of work items in every project...<br>
								
								So, estimators, those amongst you who think estimates might not be the perfect fit and would like to know more, 
								please take your seat.<br>

								Right, what we have left are the zealots. Don't worry, I know your faces and I see where to 
								expect the heckles from!</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Before we start into the meat of the topic, I wanted to make sure that we can all agree on what an estimate is?
							The dictionary calls it a:
							Rough calculation or judgement regarding the value, number, quantity or extent of something
							Now, what that something actually is depends on your situation but in all instances estimates are approximations, guesses or evaluations based on something else.
							Seems quite unnerving to think we base the future of our businesses on something so brittle as a guess.</p>

					<h2>Estimation issues</h2>
					<h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Harmful and personal</li>
							<li class="fragment">Binary and Compound</li>
							<!-- <li class="fragment">Inefficient (Wasteful)</li> -->
							<li class="fragment">Incomplete...</li>
							<!-- <li class="fragment">Biased</li> -->
						</ol>
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>OK, I admit it. I said I had three points, but this one has two in it. Sorry  :)<br>
						<ol>
							<li>Let's start with an easy one. Estimates are harmful because they build a bridge into the non-agile 
							planning world and thus prevent the transition to an agile product development and personal because more often
						than not, the person completing the work doesn't create the estimate.</li>
							<li>
						<p>I'm sure you have all been in the situation where you've estimated the features which have been agreed 
							to go into the next sprint. Excellent, job done! Hopefully. I see a problem here.</p>

						<p>These problems are two-fold: 
							Each item you estimate with a single figure value has a 50% chance of success. Like the toss of a fair coin.
							It then has a binary state, either success or failure. Anything up to and including your estimated
							time is success any even one minute beyond it equals failure.
							This 'feature' becomes coumpounded when you add individual items together to form something larger... 
							a Sprint, for example. Basing the sprint on multiple estimates changes the equation from how likely is 
							it to throw one head to; How likely is it to throw heads 10 times in a row? 1000 to one... that's a 0.09% 
						chance of success. Yay estimation!</p>

						<!-- <li><p>In lean thinking, waste is anything which doesn't add value. I think estimations are waste as they don't 
							add value to the customer. Some people suggest that it helps the customer know how long it's going to take and 
							they can see how expensive each feauture is. I say humbug. That's non-agile-thinking; 
							The project can only ever take as long as there is money for the development, spending that money on estimates 
							is a waste and if the Product Owner doesn't already know which feature is the most important, then we have 
							problems which estimates won't fix.</p> -->

							<!-- <p>Efficiencies are paradoxical. We think that keeping people busy is the best way to get more done.
								But, the more we have to do, the longer it takes to do each thing as there’s more to maintain.<br>
								Backlog grooming takes time<br>
								Choosing the right thing to work on takes time<br>
								Just having a long list of stuff to do, makes things slower (system slowdown, cognitive load)<br>
								Rather than seeing how many thing can one dev juggle, we should be focusing on making single items 
								flow through our systems faster<br>
							 A four-lane road is an excellent way to transport things quickly, but if you try to transport too many things, there will be traffic.</p> -->
							</li>

							<!-- <li><p>Estimates of individual items of work don’t include the accidental complications resulting in complex systems:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>change-over time between work items - Ideally each item should take one day… but people don’t always work one day</li>
									<li>waiting time</li>
									<li>Sickness, holidays</li>
									<li>Computer problems</li>
									<li>Expedited work</li>
									<li>Didn’t understand the problem, problems</li>
									<li>Internal discussion on the solution</li>
									<li>Queueing!</li>
									<li>Building a release</li>
									<li>Re-factoring</li>
									<li>Technical debt</li> -->

						<!-- <li><p>Whether we know it or not, we are all influenced by cognitive bias 
							They are not things we can easily turn on or off.
							Bandwagon effect (Groupthink) - Always going to happen in a group estimation situation<br>
							Anchoring Bias - Over-reliance on the first bit of information they hear. Loudest voice creates the anchor<br>
							Overconfidence (Optimism Bias) - Everyone thinks they can achieve the goal faster… we don’t want to look weak! Planning Fallacy<br>
							Confirmation bias - Once we have our mind mafde up, it’s difficult to change, we only believe info which confirms our belief<br>
							Salience - We tend to focus on the most easily recognisable features of a concept… glossing over the details, where the time will be spent.</p>
						</li> -->
					
						</ul>
						<p>This list isn't exhaustive by any means, I started off with a top 10, whittled it down to 5 and then, for this shorter session, 
							down to three. Hopefully they give you insight to the limitations of relying
							on estimates and treating them as promises rather than guesses.</p>

					<h2>Heijunka: Level the flow</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One thing which people ask about, when I describe this method to them, is the inconsistency in effort required
							per card/issue/etc which would mean forecasting won't work.
							Firstly, small variations in size won't matter. The forecast range will tak them into account.
							If you're talking about larger differences, then, we need to follow the basic rules for writing user stories
							which pretty much all scrum masters have been promoting for years. Cards should be small enough to complete within an 
							iteration... and if you want to complete more than one thing per iteration or have more than one person working at a times
							they need to be smaller than that. Ideally, to limit the impact of context switching, stories should be completed within
							one working day. Hopefully, this is nothing new to anyone in the room. 
							So, just as in Lean flow, as you reduce variation you will get predicability and forecasting becomes more useful.
							This will happen natually during a project, for example, I've experienced
							a team who, once we'd stopped estimating, were consistently completing between 10 and 12 cards per week. 
							This gave us predictability	and as long as the team were involved in the creation of the cards, the status quo was kept.
