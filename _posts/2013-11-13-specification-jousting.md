> The lively interplay of differing opinions based on a previously signed-off and mutually agreed document

If you've ever worked a fixed-price project on either side of the fence, you're sure to have come across this situation:

The end of the project is nigh and time is very tight. The product over which blood, sweat and tears have been spilt, barely resembles the first thoughts of the product let alone the specification document created in the flush of excitement when little was known and less had been considered.  

At this stage, even though all changes (should) have been agreed, documented and signed-off, once people in important roles start asking nervous questions.

Also akin to a civil war:

> A civil war is a high-intensity conflict, often involving regular armed forces, that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars may result in large numbers of casualties and the consumption of significant resources. [[Hironaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war#cite_note-hironaka3-3)]
