excerpt: In an agile world, one of the most difficult things to get 'agile' is the
  design process, there seems to be a general fear of agile encroaching into domains
  outside of the traditional developer roles.

Every bit of information available on the internet needs a design, even the computer-consumed data has to be laid-out in a specific way to ensure that it can be understood.

## Design is dead!
In my experience, having design as an up-front, once-only task causes waterfall-like symptoms; re-work, change requests, [Specification jousting](/thesaurus/specification-jousting) and the worst knock-on effect, like a spy in the ranks, an erosion in confidence of the process being used.

Now think of those PhotoShop designs; they are a merely a snapshot at a particular point in time displaying what a user will see as they perform a specific action in their normal usage of the website. When in reality, the developer wants to know how the design 'works' for a user; e.g.
- What should happen when they hover their mouse over an element?
- What should happen when the slider gets to the end of its cycle?
- How fast should the pretty CSS3 button animation be on mouseover and mouseout?
-...etc. etc.
Far too much information is neither captured or communicated, resulting in design guess-work being done by someone who probably isn't a designer, I would liken it to teaching someone how to juggle by showing them three photos of someone before they start juggling, mid-juggle and once they've finished.

The problem is interaction; when was the last time you saw an utterly flat and lifeless website, without *any* moving elements, CSS or JavaScript effects? Probably not since the mid-90's.

Fire-and-forget design also puts too much emphasis on the design skills of the developers. I have experienced few projects where I a developer has not had to implement changes and reinterpret designs as requirements morph, wither and bubble to the surface of the backlog. Some developers may relish this opportunity to knock designs about and test their 'creative' sides but many other do not... Often, they are not designers for a very good reason!

Even the simplest website should no longer be a 'brochure-ware' solution. Websites and applications are becoming repositories for information to be consumed on a myriad of different devices. It's becoming 'normal' to view and use data by other means of consumption be they mobile applications, social media, search engines or sibling sites within a brand.

- Web design with PSDs or flat screens is no longer suitable for modern websites with immersive experiences
- Miss the pulse of the site

- More and more sites are becoming repositories for multiple channels of information consumption, We're not quite at a stage of 'Write once, publish many' across the board, but it's becoming 'normal' for people to expect their web site/app data can be distributed by other means of consumption be they mobile applications, social media, search engines or sibling sites within a brand.
- Design can't just cater for a single view of a static web-page any longer, it needs to move with the demand. 
- Designers need to become part of the content architecture, as well as it's myriad of displays which will make things better for the content owner and consumer.
 
##Long live design!
Design is important, we can't *not* have a design in our projects. That would be bad.
We've spent long years learning and improving our methods of working with projects on almost all other aspects
- Agile/continuous design
- Don't just involve the designer at the start of the process, they need to be there throughout
- Requirements, thoughts and designs should all change at the same rate and include design input
- Use Style Tiles to get the initial essence of the site across
- Wire-frames are essential to flesh-out ideas
- Design during each sprint of work, starting inside out.
